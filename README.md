ðŸ§® Sorting Algorithms

            1. Bubble Sort
                Concept: Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
                Time Complexity: O(nÂ²).
                Space Complexity: O(1).

            2. Insertion Sort
                Concept: Builds the sorted array one element at a time by comparing and shifting elements.
                Time Complexity: O(nÂ²).
                Space Complexity: O(1).
                
            3. Merge Sort
                Concept: Divides the array into halves, sorts each half, and merges them.
                Time Complexity: O(n log n).
                Space Complexity: O(n).
                
            4. Quick Sort
                Concept: Picks a pivot and partitions the array around the pivot.
                Time Complexity: O(n log n) (average), O(nÂ²) (worst case).
                Space Complexity: O(log n).
                
            5. Selection Sort
                Concept: Repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element and moves it to the correct position.
                Time Complexity: O(nÂ²).
                Space Complexity: O(1).
                
            6. Heap Sort
                Concept: Uses a heap to repeatedly extract the maximum (or minimum) element.
                Time Complexity: O(n log n).
                Space Complexity: O(1).
